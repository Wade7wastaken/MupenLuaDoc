# MupenLuaDoc

Documentation for [Mupen64](https://github.com/mkdasher/mupen64-rr-lua-)'s
custom lua functions. You can find online documentation
[here](https://wade7wastaken.github.io/MupenLuaDoc/). You can also get
intellisense for VS Code by installing the Lua Language Server extension and
copying `api.lua` into your project. You do not need to run `api.lua`, simply
include it in the root folder.


Huge thanks to [@tjk113](https://github.com/tjk113) for helping me put this together.
