# MupenLuaDoc

STILL A WIP

Documentation for [Mupen64](https://github.com/mkdasher/mupen64-rr-lua-)'s
custom lua functions. You can find online documentation
[here](https://wade7wastaken.github.io/MupenLuaDoc/). You can also get
intellisense for VS Code by installing the Lua Language Server extension and
copying `api.lua` into your project.
